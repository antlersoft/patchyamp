Ampache Music Player
====================

Patchy AMP is an open-source music player for the Android platform, motivated by my
inability to find a good Android Apache client without annoying flaws.  Patchy AMP
is developed by antlersoft, the developer of the VNC Viewer for Android, the most successful
open-source VNC software for Android.

Patchy AMP started as a fork of the UAMP sample application, and it retains its goals of working 
across multiple form factors and providing a consistent user experience
on Android phones, tablets, Android Auto, Android Wear, Android TV and Google Cast devices.  It
also will provide a robust client for Ampache music servers, with a special emphasis on
providing support for smart playlists, which I've found are the most useful features of
Ampache.
